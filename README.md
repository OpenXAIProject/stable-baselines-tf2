# Stable Baselines with TF 2.0

This repository is based on the original implementations of Stable Baselines. (https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines)

In this version, we pursuit following properties:
1. Easy to debug using Eager-execution and Tensorflow 2.0.
2. Easy to read, as simple as possible.
